# Shila Drupal

A setup for multiple Drupal sites and codebases.

Shila Drupal expects to live in the following directory structure:

```
SHILA_ROOT
├── code
│   └── shila-drupal
└── data
    ├── drupal-files
    └── sql-dumps
```

See [Shila Vagrant](https://github.com/aleksip/shila-vagrant) for a working setup in a Vagrant box.
