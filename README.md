# Shila Drupal

A multi-site Drupal setup with support for multiple Drupal versions.

Shila Drupal expects to live in the following directory structure:

```
SHILA_ROOT
├── code
│   └── shila-drupal
└── data
    ├── drupal-files
    └── sql-dumps
```

See [Shila Vagrant](https://github.com/aleksip/shila-vagrant) for a working setup in a Vagrant box.

Drupal 8 setup is based on [drupal-project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project).
